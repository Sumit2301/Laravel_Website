It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of &quot;de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum&quot; (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, &quot;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..&quot;, comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>', '2021-12-02 07:37:34', '2021-12-02 07:37:34'),

(31, 'How to Ace NEET PG 2023: Study Tips for Medical Students', '<p>NEET PG (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test for Post Graduate courses), to be held on 5th March, 2023, is an important exam for medical students in India who want to pursue their postgraduate studies in medicine. It is a highly competitive exam and therefore requires a well-planned study strategy to ace it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some study tips that can help you prepare for NEET PG 2023:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Understand the Exam Pattern: Before starting your preparation, it is important to understand the exam pattern, marking scheme and syllabus. The exam consists of 300 multiple-choice questions and the duration of the exam is 3 hours and 30 minutes. Each correct answer carries 4 marks and there is a negative marking of 1 mark for each incorrect answer. The syllabus covers all the subjects studied in MBBS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Create a Study Plan: Create a study plan that is realistic, achievable and suits your learning style. Allocate sufficient time for each subject and give extra time to your weak areas. You can divide your study time into three phases- initial preparation, revision and practice tests. Make sure you follow your study plan religiously and avoid procrastination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Study from Standard Textbooks: NEET PG is a test of your conceptual knowledge, and therefore, it is important to study from standard textbooks. Some of the recommended textbooks are Harrison&#39;s Principles of Internal Medicine, Davidson&#39;s Principles and Practice of Medicine, Robbins and Cotran Pathologic Basis of Disease and Bailey and Love&#39;s Short Practice of Surgery. Make sure you understand the concepts thoroughly and do not just memorise them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use Online Resources: There are several online resources that can be very helpful for NEET PG preparation. You can use websites like Medical Dialogues, Medical News Today and Medscape for the latest updates in the field of medicine. You can also join online forums and discussion groups where you can interact with other medical students and experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Solve Previous Year Question Papers: Solving previous year question papers is a great way to understand the exam pattern, time management and your strengths and weaknesses. It will also help you identify the frequently asked topics and the level of difficulty of the exam. You can download previous year question papers from the official website of NBE (National Board of Examinations).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take Mock Tests: Mock tests are an important part of NEET PG preparation as they simulate the real exam environment. You can take mock tests online or offline and analyse your performance after each test. Make sure you take mock tests regularly and keep track of your progress.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay Healthy and Motivated: It is important to stay healthy and motivated during your NEET PG preparation.

The exam is to be&nbsp; conducted by the National Board of Examinations (NBE) on 5th March, 2023. Aspirants who are preparing for NEET PG 2023 are likely to experience stress and anxiety given the intense competition and the importance of the exam in their career.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Managing exam stress and anxiety is essential for achieving success in NEET PG 2023. In this article, we will discuss some effective strategies for managing exam stress and anxiety.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Start early: Starting early with your preparation is one of the best ways to manage exam stress. When you start early, you have more time to prepare and revise which reduces the last-minute stress.</li>\r\n	<li>Create a study plan: A study plan helps you to stay organised and focused. Divide your syllabus into manageable chunks and allocate a specific time for each topic. Having a study plan helps you to track your progress and make necessary adjustments.</li>\r\n	<li>Take regular breaks: Taking regular breaks is essential to manage stress and improve concentration. Studying continuously for long hours can cause burnout and reduce productivity. Take a short break of 10-15 minutes every 1-2 hours to refresh your mind.</li>\r\n	<li>Exercise regularly: Exercise is an excellent stress buster. Regular exercise not only reduces stress and anxiety but also improves cognitive function. Exercise also improves blood circulation which enhances brain function.</li>\r\n	<li>Practice meditation and deep breathing: Meditation and deep breathing techniques help to calm the mind and reduce stress. Spend a few minutes every day practising deep breathing and meditation to improve focus and concentration.</li>\r\n	<li>Get enough sleep: Sleep is crucial for overall health and well-being. Lack of sleep can lead to fatigue, irritability and reduced productivity. Aim to get 7-8 hours of quality sleep every night to stay fresh and alert.</li>\r\n	<li>Eat a balanced diet: A balanced diet is essential for brain function and overall health. Eat a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and lean protein. Avoid processed and junk food which can affect your mood and energy levels.</li>\r\n	<li>Stay positive: Positive thinking is vital for managing exam stress. Avoid negative self-talk and focus on your strengths. Visualise success and stay motivated.</li>\r\n	<li>Seek support: Talk to family, friends or a mentor for emotional support. Share your concerns and anxieties with them. They can provide valuable insights and help you to stay motivated.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, managing exam stress and anxiety is essential for achieving success in NEET PG 2023.

(8, 'Number of MBBS Seats Increased', '<p>The other side of the reality is that it is impossible for a middle-class family to afford private medical education and seats in government medical colleges are few and therefore open only to the most meritorious. The promoters of private medical colleges, like engineering colleges, are often without any earlier exposure to education and of variable integrity and will extract as much from the market as they can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fees for a degree in private medical colleges can go up to Rs 1 crore when a government college charges between Rs 67,000 and Rs 3 lakh. No wonder, parents often find a medical degree in countries like Russia, China and Ukraine cheaper than a privately acquired one in India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The prime minister has invited the private sector to take up a bigger role in delivering medical education. Anand Mahindra, head of the eponymous automobile group, has asked his educational complex in Hyderabad which delivers engineering, management and legal education to look into medical education also.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One reason why there are fewer private medical seats than engineering is that private deliverers have kept away from medical education which has to be imparted over a longer duration. This means simultaneously there will be more batches going through the course and thus there is a need for more infrastructure. An MBBS course, including internship, needs 5.5 years to deliver whereas a bachelor&rsquo;s course in management takes three.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus private investment in medical education is best done by those entities which can live with a longer gestation period and that typically comes with a degree of commitment to the idea. Hence, the prime minister&rsquo;s plea is best responded to by the corporate sector which has a longer perspective than other businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A fundamental question remains. How have Russia, China and Ukraine come to acquire a degree of capability in delivering medical education which India has not been able to? The answer is that they are all more developed countries with a higher per capita GDP and a longer experience in the development process than India.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The desperation to get an affordable foreign medical education is apparent from the fact that leaving aside the top three countries and Kirgizstan whose degree holders appear for the qualifying Indian test, Nepal accounted for 7.6 per cent and Bangladesh 2 per cent in 2018-19 (the latest figures available). The question that India needs to ask is what have Nepal and Bangladesh got that India has not.</p>', 'number-of-mbbs-seats-increased', '164733653791.jpeg', '164733653745.jpeg', 1, '2022-03-15', NULL, NULL, NULL, '2022-03-15 14:28:57', '2022-03-15 14:28:57');

People of&nbsp;Amritsar, Lahore, and other cities of Punjab including rich Sikh families and the Maharajas donated land and funds for the construction of Khalsa College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Khalsa College Establishment Committee was set up&nbsp;in 1890 with Colonel W.

Among the native constituents of this&nbsp;121-member committee were Sir Attar Singh, Gurdial&nbsp;Singh Maan of Nabha, Diwan Gurmukh Singh of&nbsp;Patiala, Bhai Kahn Singh, Professor Gurmukh Singh, and Sardar Jawahir Singh. Many princely states of&nbsp;British India and Sikh people of Punjab including&nbsp;Maharaja Rajendra Singh of Patiala rendered&nbsp;financial help for the establishment of Khalsa College.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>History of KCVAS</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the year 2009, Khalsa College Charitable Society Governing Council thought of starting College of Veterinary and Animal Sciences to develop technically sound human resources in the field of veterinary health, animal production, and management to cater to the increasing demand of veterinarians in the state.

Sc. &amp; A.&nbsp;H. in October 2010 with an existing staff of three&nbsp;Professors, seven Assistant Professors, and nine&nbsp;non-teaching staff. With the KCVAS building under&nbsp;construction, the College activities were initiated in&nbsp;the building of the Department of Physiotherapy,&nbsp;Khalsa College, Amritsar.&nbsp;In view of a few deficiencies in terms of infrastructure&nbsp;and faculty and in spite of best efforts by the&nbsp;management and the college staff, the permission for&nbsp;admission of the second batch of students during the&nbsp;2011- 12 session was withheld by VCI. Though there&nbsp;was no major deficiency still there prevailed an&nbsp;uncertainty even for the conduct of the annual&nbsp;examination and the students were stressed regarding&nbsp;their careers. With the constant encouragement from&nbsp;the Honorary Secretary, S. Rajinder Mohan Chinna,&nbsp;and untiring efforts by S. Ajmer Singh, Legal&nbsp;Secretary, and Dr. S. K. Jand, the Principal of KCVAS&nbsp;with the intervention of Hon&rsquo;ble Punjab &amp;&nbsp;Haryana High Court the annual examinations of&nbsp;students were timely conducted in June 2012, under&nbsp;the supervision of GADVASU, the affiliating University&nbsp;of KCVAS.
